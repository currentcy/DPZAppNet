DPZAppNet
=========

DPZAppNet is an App.net API kit for PHP. It requires PHP 5 with the curl extension installed.

DPZAppNet is Copyright (c) 2012 David Wilkinson and is distributed under the MIT licence.

To see how to use this library, take a look at example.php.

It's still very early days for App.net and like App.net itself, this library is a work in progress - it will no doubt
evolve as the App.net API evolves. It doesn't yet support Streams. These things will come.
